# Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship – Task Submissions

Welcome to the official repository for submitting my task solutions during the **Cybersecurity Internship** at **Elevate Labs**.
This repository contains the completed work for assigned tasks, structured and documented for clarity, traceability, and assessment.  

> 📌 **Note:** All tools, techniques, and procedures are based on personal preference. While the task PDF provides recommended methods, I've explored and applied tools/processes that best suited my workflow, reflecting initiative and innovation.
